Block notifications and take control of your digital well-being<br>

Push notifications are a gift and a curse, allowing you to get notified instantly of important information, but also opening a door into letting people and apps interrupt your life without your consent. The tools Apple gives us are not powerful enough to stop the spam of notifications, and required a more advanced tool set.<br><br>

NotiBlock is an advanced notification blocking and filtering tweak. It lets you block notifications based many fields for simple or advanced configurations. Features include blocking based on:<br>
- Content of the notification<br>
- What app the notification is from<br>
- Whitelist mode to only allow certain notifications through<br>
- Block notifications completely or just mute them<br>
- Schedules, to only block certain times and days of the week.<br><br>
